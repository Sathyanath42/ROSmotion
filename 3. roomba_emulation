Here we emulate the motion of a roomba machine in cleaning a room with turtlesim
We will deifne the following functions:
1. void move (double speed, double distance, bool is_forward)
2. void rotate (double angular_speed, double angle, bool clockwise)
   double degrees2radians(double angle_in_degrees)
3. void moveGoal(tutrlesim::Pose goal_pose, double distance_tolerance): gives the end position and the amount of error that can be tolerated

!. Moving in a straight line
