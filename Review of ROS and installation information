Create a new catkin workspace
$ mkdir catkinm_ws
~/catkinm_ws$ mkdir src
~/catkinm_ws$ catkin_make

Finally define the following lines in the ~/.bashrc file
source /home/sathyanath/catkinm_ws/devel/setup.bash

Ensure that other catkin workspaces are commented out

The IDE to be used is visual studio code which has an inbuilt interpreter and code completion features.
Further the required file under the src file can be simply dragged and dropped into the workspace.
