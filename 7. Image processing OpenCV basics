The followng code deals with processing images into there forms, RGB, HSV and Greyscale

****************************************************************
Thresholding: Mainly two types , Simple and adaptive thresholding
Simple thresholding: If a pixel is greater than a certain value it is assigned to white ie 255, adn assigned to black ie 0 when below that value
Adpative thresholding: Better suited for varying lighting conditions, the threshold is calculated for a small region, different regions different thresholds.
This can be in terms of mean of the region or wighted sum of the thresholded values (Gaussian)
