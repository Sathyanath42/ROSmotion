The followng code deals with processing images into there forms, RGB, HSV and Greyscale

#import numpy, a data structure that will handle the image
#library for storing multi dimensional arrays

import numpy as np 
import cv2

print 'read an image from the file'
color_image = cv2.imread("images/"+image_name+".jpg",cv2.IMREAD_COLOR)

# creating a window holder for the image'
#cv2.namedWindow("Image", cv2.WINDOW_NORMAL) #default is cv2.WINDOW_AUTOSIZE, what ive used allows us to resize the window

print 'display the image in native color'
cv2.imshow("Image",color_image)
cv2.moveWindow("Original Image",0,0) 
#used to display in a window, must be used with the bottom command: waitKey
print(color_image.shape) 
#prints shape of the image ie It returns a tuple of the number of rows, columns, and channels (if the image is color)

height,width,channels = color_image.shape

#splitting the image in terms of rgb
print 'slipt the image into three channels.'
blue,green,red = cv2.split(color_image)

cv2.imshow("Blue Channel",blue)
cv2.moveWindow("Blue Channel",0,height)

cv2.imshow("Red Channel",red)
cv2.moveWindow("Red Channel",0,height)

cv2.imshow("Green Channel",green)
cv2.moveWindow("Green Channel",0,height)

#splitting the image in terms of hue , saturation and value, better in lighted conditions

print '---- slipt the image into Hue, Saturation, Value channels.----- '
hsv = cv2.cvtColor(color_image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2HSV) #allows us to convert RGB to HSV

#cv2.waitKey(0)

#print 'image copied to folder images/copy/'

****************************************************************
Thresholding: Mainly two types , Simple and adaptive thresholding
Simple thresholding: If a pixel is greater than a certain value it is assigned to white ie 255, adn assigned to black ie 0 when below that value
Adpative thresholding: Better suited for varying lighting conditions, the threshold is calculated for a small region, different regions different thresholds.
This can be in terms of mean of the region or wighted sum of the thresholded values (Gaussian)
