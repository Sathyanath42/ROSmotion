For the duration of this ill be using ROS melodic with an ubuntu version 18.04. 
Ill be using the virtual machine from oracle to set up the environment and visual studio code as the IDE

****************************************************Creating workspaces*****************************************************

Create a new catkin workspace
$ mkdir catkinm_ws
~/catkinm_ws$ mkdir src
~/catkinm_ws$ catkin_make

Finally define the following lines in the ~/.bashrc file
source /home/sathyanath/catkinm_ws/devel/setup.bash

Ensure that other catkin workspaces are commented on out to prevent the script from launching with an unintended workspace
The IDE to be used is visual studio code which has an inbuilt interpreter and code completion features.
Further the required file under the src file can be simply dragged and dropped into the workspace.

***************************************Setting up github to access files via command*********************************************

$ sudo apt-get install git
~/catkin_ws/src$ git clone 
https://github.com/aniskoubaa/ros_essentials_cpp.git

This will give us a copy of the folder in our workspace within src
run catkin_make to ensure the files are in order.
