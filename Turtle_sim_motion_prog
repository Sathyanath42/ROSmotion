The aim is to produce a program that provides commands to the turtle sim to make it move by subscribing to the topic we provide - Positon of the Robot

***************************************************Python Code

#this serves as a subscriber to the motion info topic 
#and serves as a publisher to feed the directions to the turtle
#find topics that give the position
#find topics that make it move
#!/usr/bin/env python
import rospy
#from std_msgs.msg import String 
from geometry_msgs.msg import Twist
from turtlesim.msg import Pose

def callback_receive_motion_data()

# We import std_msgs to use the message string which contains a simple string data in it.

def turt_mov():

    rospy.init_node('turtle_mov_cmd')
    sub = rospy.Subscriber("/turtle1/pose",Pose, callback_receive_motion_data)
#This tells rospy the name of the node
#if we add anonymous = True, then the uniqueness of the node is confirmed by adding random numbers at the end of the node.

    pub = rospy.Publisher("/turtle1/cmd_vel",Twist,queue_size=10) 

#We create a publisher with a name , a type and a queue size
#Here queue_size acts as a buffer to give time for the subscriber to receive the message

    rospy.spin()

#Along with the method sleep(), it offers an easy way to set the desired rate
#WIth an argument of 2, the loop would run 2 times in a second
